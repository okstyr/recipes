- simmer for a little while (< 8mins - full 8 mins if hanging)
  - whole almonds should be just a little tender
  - doesnt that smell nice?
- when taking off heat, add bicarb and stir in (doesnt smell so nice now does it?)
- if doing this on the day of cooking, stand to cool for 5 mins, then place saucepan in sink of icewater to cool

## removing the pudding

- invert steamer onto a plate
- its ready to serve now, or it can be wrapped in some cling wrap and put in the fridge

### pudding cloth
- lift the pudding out of the water immediately
- hang it up somewhere breezy
- after a day or so take the pudding down place on a cooling rack, and unwrap it (but leave it sitting on the cloth)
- leave it for a day or two to dry out
- re-wrap it and hang it for several months
- check every now and then for mold
- if you find it cut it out and douse area in rum
- every time you check you should pour a little more rum on it anyway

## re-heating pudding
on the day of eating, boil the pudding again for 2.5 hours in a similar fashion to the way it was cooked (cloth or steamer)

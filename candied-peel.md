# candied peel
"you dont candy your own peel" - old saying

## ingredients
for approx 200g candied peel

- 4 oranges (unwaxed if you can)
- 2 lemons (unwaxed if you can)
- a litre or two of water
- upto 500g of sugar

## method
- chop the ends off the fruit
- cut into the peel (just the peel) as if you were quatering the fruit
- remove the peel
- use the fruit for whatever you like. if you imagination fails you, chop them and put them in a blender wiith a teaspoon of sugar (optional) for a nice thick orage-lemon juice.
## de-bittering the peel
this can be done twice for less bitter peel. also orage peel is more bitter than lemon, so this depends on the ratio of oranges to lemons.
- put peel into a saucepan and cover liberally with water
- bring to boil and boil for 15 minutes, stiring occasionally
- drain peel
## syrupising
- repeat the debittering step, but this time dont throw out the water
- by weight, add as much sugar as there is water
- put the sugar water and the peel back in the saucepan and boil for at least 30 min or so
- note that due to the increased density of the sugar water, the peel will float initially, so stir frequently
- you are aiming for the peel to become translucent - how translucent it gets depends on the time and the fruit itself
## draining
- remove the peel from the saucepan and put on a rack to drain. it could take a few days. if you are impatient you can try a very low oven or a food dryer.
- the syrup can be refrigerated or frozen. it has a bunch of uses, especially in drinks. eg, if you have rum left over from the pudding recipe, this syrup will go quite nice with some of that, over ice.
## uses for the peel
most recipes say slice it and coat it with sugar. et voila! peel lollies. I just make it a few days before i need peel for another recipe, and chop it into cubes. it is sooooo much better than bought candied peel, which tastes like someone told a drunk chemist what oranges and lemons were.
